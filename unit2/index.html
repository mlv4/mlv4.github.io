		<h2>Which two websites inspire?</h2>
			<p>Two fun websites to check out are <a href="http://www.ted.com">TED.COM</a> and <a href="http:www.projectfixup.com">projectfixup.com</a></p>

		<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
			
			<p>There are tons of TED talks available, so the design challenge would be to organize them in a way that makes them readily accessible, yet not overwhelming. I think the designers succeeded. In the header, there is a slider filled with photos and content teasers of varying sizes. There is white background peeking through in asymmetric ways. A viewer can scroll through the slider, and the upcoming photos/teasers are grayed-out. This gray-out of upcoming information signals to the viewer what's coming up, but emphasizes what is immediately accessible. In the body, the photos and teasers for the most recent TED talks are displayed in different sizes and shapes. The background is present in unexpected ways. This variety in positive and negative space keeps the viewer's eyes engaged.</p>

			<p>When I log in to projectfixup.com, the flat, bold colors of the large user input boxes convey a sense of simplicity and order that reflects well on the company. My profile and preferences page consists of the same large columns of the home page (cohesion!), and it is easy to make changes. These folks successfully convey the idea that they "do the work so I don't have to," through these straightforward arrangements. My only beef is that there seems to be a dearth of available men in Chicago, harumph, so there have not been too many fixups after 10 weeks. Oh, well, in the meantime, I am happy to refer friends, partially because it's a cool website :-).</p>  


		<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
			<p>They serve the mission of their organizations effectively: TED.com, to present "ideas worth sharing"; projectfixup.com, to make dating less of a hassle. Their missions are different, so their websites will be, as well. The former has a ton of information that flows in a logical way. The latter engages the customer with its simplicity. </p>		

		<h2>Thumbnail Sketches for the blog, "Resuscitate You, Resuscitate Me: Wellness for Women in Emergency Medicine"</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Home Page options 1 and 2</strong>
					<img src="images/1homepageoptions1and2.jpg">
					<p>Option 1 for the home page is organized on a 5-column basis (with two columns being the margins). New blog entries will go on the left, below the header. The blog's seven sections can be accessed through the column on the right. Pretty straighforward. Option 2 has the new blog posts centered beneath the header. Sections will be represented by photos or graphics in seven separate boxes. The hope is for readers to have access to the newest material easily and to make past information from other sections easy to find. </p>
				</li>	

				<li><strong>Section options 1 and 2</strong>
					<img src="images/2section-options1and2.jpg">
					<p>These are two options for a Section page. Option 1 maintains cohesion with the home page by sticking to the 5 column structure. "Calls to action" (search box, viewing prior posts from this section, sharing to social media and links to other good wellness-related websites) are on the right. In Option 2, the "action" links are immediately below the header. New posts follow. This option might be a little easier on the eyes.</p>
