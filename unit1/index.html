     	<h1>About Me</h1>

     		<p>I'm excited to take the class for two reasons. First, coding and design are new frontiers for me. Second, part of my current job includes teaching. It is good to revisit the feeling of being a novice.</p>
     	
     	<h2>My Mission</h2>

     		<p>...to learn!</p>

     	<h2>My Experience</h2>

     		<p>This is how I evolved professionally:</p>

     			<li><strong>Student</strong>, College<br>
     				<em>Upper Midwest</em>, Some time ago</br>
<br></br>
     			<Li><strong>Student</strong>, Yet More School<br>
     				<em>Home State of IL</em>, Not Too Long Ago</br>
<br></br>
				<Li><strong>Current Gig</strong><br>
					<em>Chicago</em>, Now</Li></br></p>

		<h2>Education</h2>
		
			<p>Yes, but more needed</p>

		<h2>Other</h2>
		
			<p>I'm electronically old-fashioned. Not on FB. I kinda' like to meet in-person before dishing about myself. Sorry about the vagueness above.</p>

			<p>If you want to collaborate, please feel free to contact me,<a href="mailto:writemem@gmail.com">MV.</p>
